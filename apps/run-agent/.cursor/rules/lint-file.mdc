# Linting Guide

- only touch the file that user asks for.

## Guide

- use `just lint {file-name}` to lint the file.
- you can view the last 100 lines with `just tail-log`.
- there may be a lot of linting warning/errors. In that case, fix a few lint error at a time:
    - identify the line numbers of the warning/error.
    - only edit those lines and nothing else.
    - do not try to fix errors by editing the whole file.
- if the error/warning persists after multiple attempts:
    - add `# type: ignore` at the end of line.
- run until `just lint {file-name}` produces no errors.
